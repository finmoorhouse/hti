We produce this podcast on our own time, and episodes can take between 10â€“20 hours to complete. We do not run ads, so your donation will help us pay for hosting and invest in new equipment (and caffeine).

Special thank you to the [EA Infrastructure Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community) for supporting us with a series of grants in the past. This covered our time as we worked on the podcast, especially over the pandemic. If you have a project you think could improve the world, we highly recommend thinking about applying to an [EA Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/).

EA Funds is also [looking for donations](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zt6MsCCDStm74HFwo/ea-funds-organisational-update-open-philanthropy-matching) of its own. Your donations will be matched 2Ã— by Open Philanthropy.
