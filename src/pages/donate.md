We're fortunate enough that money is *not* currently a major constraint on producing this podcast, so we don't think direct donations to us are competitive with other comparable donation opportunities in impact terms.

If you are looking for a place to support early-stage projects similar to our own, consider [donating to the Infrastructure Fund](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/effective-altruism-infrastructure-fund) or another [EA Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/) â€” Open Philanthropy (a philanthropic organisation) will **match your donations 2x**.

We're grateful to the [EA Infrastructure Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community) for supporting us with a series of grants. This covered our time as we worked on the podcast, especially over the pandemic. If you have a project you think could improve the world, strongly consider [applying to get funded](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/apply-for-funding).

Of course, that doesn't mean we'd *turn down* tips!
