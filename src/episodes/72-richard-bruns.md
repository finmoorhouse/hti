In this episode we talk about the importance of indoor air quality (IAQ), and how to improve it. Including:

* The health burden of particulate matter (especially PM 2.5)
* How many additional respiratory virus infections are caused by unclean air
* Estimating the total DALY cost of unclean indoor air in the US
* How much pandemic risk could be reduced from improving IAQ?
* How economists convert health losses into dollar figures â€” and how *not* to put a price on life
* Key interventions to improve IAQ
  * Air filtration
  * Germicidal UV light (especially Far-UVC light)
    * Barriers to adoption, including UV smog and empirical studies needed most
* National and state-level policy changes to get these interventions adopted widely
* Why was classic sci-fi so influential? What cultural attitudes does it exhibit that recent sci-fi doesn't?
