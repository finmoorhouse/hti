While we often hear warnings about catastrophic cyberattacks, it's often surprisingly difficult to understand what such attacks would actually require. And when you dig into historical cyber operations, they often look messier and less successful than media coverage might suggest.

Smeet’s two recent books speak to this question *[No Shortcuts: Why States Struggle to Develop a Military Cyber-Force](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59978777-no-shortcuts)* and *[Ransom War: How Cyber Crime Became a Threat to National Security](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214661015-ransom-war)*.

In this interview, we discuss:

- The different types of cyber operations that a nation state might launch, and how the international norms formed around which cyberattacks are tolerated or condemned;
- The challenges that even elite cyber forces face — like why [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) remains the go-to example for a successful and sophistical cyberattack after two decades, and what we can learn from the relative absence of major destruction from cyberattacks in the Russia-Ukraine conflict;
- How to assess the sophistication of cyber forces, and what capabilities future AI systems would need to develop to meaningfully expand or proliferate advanced cyber skills.
