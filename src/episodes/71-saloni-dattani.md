In this episode we talk about:

* The history of malaria and attempts to eradicate it
* The role of [DDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT#History) and insecticide spraying campaigns — and why they were scaled down
* [Why we didn’t get a malaria vaccine sooner](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-didnt-get-a-malaria-vaccine-sooner)
* What comes after vaccine discovery — rolling out the RTS,S vaccine
* New funding models to accelerate similar life-saving research, like vaccines for TB and HIV
* Why so much global health data is missing, and why that matters
* How the 'million deaths study' revealed that about 50,000 deaths per year from snakebites in India went uncounted by health agencies
