In this episode we talk about:

* The history of malaria and attempts to eradicate it
* The role of [DDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT#History) and insecticide spraying campaigns — and why they were scaled down
* [Why we didn’t get a malaria vaccine sooner](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-didnt-get-a-malaria-vaccine-sooner)
* What comes after vaccine discovery — rolling out the RTS,S vaccine
* New funding models to accelerate similar life-saving research, like vaccines for TB and HIV
* Why so much global health data is missing, and why that matters
* How the 'million deaths study' revealed that about 50,000 deaths per year from snakebites in India went uncounted by health agencies

## Corrections

- The [*Cinchona* tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinchona) is not pronounced "kin-chona" but rather [/sɪŋˈkoʊnə/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=s%C9%AA%C5%8B%CB%88ko%CA%8An%C9%99) or [/sɪnˈtʃoʊnə/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=s%C9%AAn%CB%88t%CA%83o%CA%8An%C9%99), i.e. "syn-kona" or "syn-chona"
- "Sporozoite" is not pronounced with an -e as in "bee" sound at the end, but rather [/spɔːrəˈzəʊ.aɪts/](/spɔːrəˈzəʊ.aɪts/) or [/spɒrəˈzəʊ.ɪts/](/spɒrəˈzəʊ.ɪts/)[^1], i.e. "spore" – "oh" – "zo"-as-in-"Zoe" – "ites"-as-in-"nights" 

[^1]: ChatGPT generated these [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) words so they might not be entirely accurate!
