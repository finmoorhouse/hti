In this episode we talk about:

- Life-saving health technologies which [probably won't exist in 5 years](https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/10-technologies-that-wont-exist-in-5-yrs/) (without a concerted effort). Such as:
  - A widely available TB vaccine
  - A widely available [vaccine for Strep A](https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/strep/)
  - Bugs and which stop malaria spreading, like [a fungus which appears to block the transmission](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16121-y) of the [malaria parasite](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/tropical-diseases/articles/10.3389/fitd.2022.957109/full)
  - ‘Monoclonal antibodies’ for malaria, which trigger immunity faster than vaccines
- How R&D for neglected diseases works —
  - How much does the world spend on R&D for neglected diseases?
  - What is [Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI)?
  - How do drugs for neglected diseases go from design to distribution?
  - Public-private ‘[product development partnerships](https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/reinventing-research/)’
- No-brainer policy ideas for speeding up global health R&D —
  - [An FDA program which speeds up drug development](https://blog.jacobtrefethen.com/how-to-make-100-million-with-no-sales/) for neglected diseases at ~zero cost to the taxpayer (and why more researchers should know about it)
  - Why the FDA should consider sharing un-redacted assessments with other countries
  - How to make vaccine procurement more predictable (and why that matters)
  - Why congress should [definitely renew PEPFAR](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24036223/pepfar-aids-hiv-africa-global-health-george-w-bush-republicans-congress)
- Comparing health R&D to public health interventions (like [bed nets](http://againstmalaria.org/))
- Comparing the social returns to frontier (‘Progress Studies’) to global health R&D
- Why is there no [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org)-equivalent for global health R&D?
- [‘Vigilante accountability projects’](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBtn8Xiz7uXXUn4462N0MnXvweuYRKShE_6_LKsTxoc/edit) and why you should consider doing one
- Won't AI do all the R&D for us soon?
